    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Wassail is a hot mulled cider with Nordic roots. It's traditionally enjoyed during wassailing, which is the ancient Yuletide practice of singing door-to-door. The ritual began as a way to ensure a good cider apple harvest for the following year and it persists today (in the form of caroling).</p>
